psychology is the study of mind and behavior [1][2]. it is an academic discipline and an applied science which seeks to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases [3][4]. in this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors. psychologists explore concepts such as perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, phenomenology, motivation, brain functioning, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. [5] psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. in addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some especially clinical and counseling psychologists at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. psychology has been described as a "hub science", [6] with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy.
